In an effort to create an inclusive, diverse, and effective training experience, we request that you submit an expression of interest. From the received applications, we will select a professionally and demographically diverse cohort of 30 people, with the capacity and influence to deploy participatory processes at scale. Selected participants will be invited to purchase a ticket.
