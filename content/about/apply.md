# Apply to Attend
      
In an effort to create an inclusive, diverse, and particpatory training experience, we ask that you submit an expression of interest. We will select 30 participants with an invitation to purchase a ticket.

We are selecting a diverse age, gender, race, and professional cohort. We are specifically interested in practicionersâ€”those who will directly be able to apply these methods.

If you have any questions, you can email us.
