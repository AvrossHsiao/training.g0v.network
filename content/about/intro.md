Taiwan has been experimenting with bringing citizens and government together in a civic deliberation process for crafting legislation or policy. Our experiments, vTaiwan and PO network bring people directly into governance and helps lawmakers implement decisions with a greater degree of legitimacy. We see our projects as an adaptable and reproducible/replicable prototype for future democracy. In this two-day workshop, we will introduce both how vTaiwan and PO network work, the design behind, the difference, and their impacts so far.
